## Getting Started with R (tiny version with isotope focus)

This is the material of a R course I give at the [IZW](http://www.izw-berlin.de/welcome.html), in Berlin, Germany.
The course is aimed at students following a summer school about isotopes.

### Note:
- the material is not supposed to be fully self explanatory, so it may be difficult to follow without my bla bla.
