## Getting Started with R

This is the material of a R course I give at the IZW, Berlin, Germany.
The course lasts one day and is aimed at preparing students to an introductory statistics course which spans 4 days following the R course.

The given version of the course will be archived here using the Git(Hub) system of tags (and releases).

Note:
- the material is not supposed to be fully self explanatory, so it may be difficult to follow without my bla bla.
- the content is adapted to the particular network architecture of the IZW (hence proxy settings as so forth, which the rest of the world won't need).
- the content is heavily "base R"-biased (and not tidyverse-biased) for historical reasons and perhaps to suit the need of the statistical procedures that follows in the course, but I may change that in the near future once I will have clarified what is required by the statistical tests I use.
