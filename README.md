## Getting Started with R

This is the material of a R course I give at the [IZW](http://www.izw-berlin.de/welcome.html), in Berlin, Germany.
The course lasts one day and is aimed at preparing students to an introductory statistics course which spans 4 days following this R introduction.

### Note:
- the material is not supposed to be fully self explanatory, so it may be difficult to follow without my bla bla.
- the current version builds on the __{tidyverse}__, check the old version from the branch `baseR` if you prefer otherwise.
