## Getting Started with R

This repository contains the material of R course I have given at the [IZW](http://www.izw-berlin.de/welcome.html), in Berlin, Germany.

This master branch correspond to a course which lasts one day and is aimed at preparing students to an introductory statistics course which spans 4 days following this R introduction.

Check other branches for other related courses.

### Notes:
- the material is not supposed to be fully self explanatory, so it may be difficult to follow without my bla bla.
- the current version of this branch builds on the __{tidyverse}__, check the old version from the branch `baseR` if you prefer otherwise.
