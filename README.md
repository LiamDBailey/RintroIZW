## Getting Started with R

This is the material of a R course I give at the IZW, Berlin, Germany.
The course lasts one day and is aimed at preparing students to an introductory statistics course which spans 4 days following the R course.

The given version of the course will be archived here using the Git(Hub) system of tags (and releases).

Note:
- the material is not supposed to be fully self explanatory, so it may be difficult to follow without my bla bla.
- the content is adapted to the particular network architecture of the IZW (hence proxy settings as so forth, which the rest of the world won't need).
- the current version builds on the Tidyverse, check the branch baseR if you prefer otherwise.
